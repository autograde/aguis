# Testing gRPC-based Autograder application on itest.run VM

There are two methods to test the application on `itest.run` endpoints of `ag2` server.
Both will require you to have an active `ag2` user. If you do not have `ag2` user yet, please contact your supervisor or unix administration.
You will also need a personal endpoint on `itest.run` (with corresponding port number): several endpoints are already set up on the server, but you can add more if needed.

## Method 1: running server locally with port forwarding to itest.run server
To test application by running the server on your own machine, you will have to use ssh port forwarding. Script files `tunnel.sh` and `hometunnel.sh` are serving that purpose. `tunnel.sh` can be used when connected to **Eduroam** network, `hometunnel.sh` can be used from anywhere. 
Tunnel scrips must be adjusted before they can be used. `lport` variable is your local port where client connection from `ag2` will be forwarded. 
Replace username at the port corresponding to endpoint given to you with your `ag2` username (or add a new one).

Currently this method only works from a Chrome browser (and only tested from Debian OS).


## Method 2: running the Autograder server on itest.run VM

Make sure you start your gRPC server on a different port from `:9090` and reconfigure your instance of Envoy to listen on a port different from `:8080`, as these ports are used by the production server and proxy. Add your endpoint and webserver port to the NGINX configuration in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`, or use one of the existing endpoints (e.g. `test.itest.run` with port `:3006`). If adding a new endpoint, make sure to add it to the main server listener, redirecting all traffic to https:

```
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        # add your new endpoint here
        server_name pedersen.itest.run meling.itest.run junaid.itest.run nicolasf.itest.run ag.itest.run test.itest.run;

        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```
Then generate a new SSl/TLS certificate with Certbot to protect the new endpoint.

gRPC client must be started with your endpoint URL (use `make remote` Makefile task to ensure recompiling with the right configuration).

Example command to start the test server on test.itest.run:
`aguis -service.url test.itest.run -database.file ./test.db -http.addr :3006 -http.public ./public &`

## Maintaining the server

To stop the server it is sufficient to run `killall aguis` command.

To update the server, run `git fetch`, then `git status` to make sure there are no local changes and the branch can be fast-forwarded.
If not, resolve local changes, preferably as new commits or pull requests to the main database. Then run `git pull`, and recompile the server (`make install`) and the client (`make ui`).

To start the server, there is a script with needed environmental variables and startup command with all necessary options provided. Run `source startag.sh` from the `aguis` folder to start the server.

 ## Accessing the server

 You will have to ssh to the production server `ag2.ux.uis.no` in order to be able to update or restart the server. You will need the access as an `autograder` user. After you've got the access, you will be able to ssh directly to `ag2` from the `Eduroam` network on campus. Otherwise you will have to ssh to `badne5.ux.uis.no` or `badne7.ux.uis.no` and then ssh into `ag2` from these servers.

 ## Server logs

 We use `logrotate` to maintain server logs. Configuration file is `/etc/logrotate.d/aguis`.
 Example configuration is:

 ```
 /home/autograder/aguis/ag.log {
        size 5M
        copytruncate
        dateext
        rotate 2
        compress
        maxage 14
}
```
This configuration will rotate the `ag.log` file when its size reaches 5Mb, it will start logging to a new file, will name a rotated file with the current date, will keep two latest log files compressed and will delete them after 2 week after the rotation.

## CI with Docker

Code submitted by students is being built and run inside Docker containers. After a container exits, the output is parsed and saved as a new submission database entry. Stopped containers are not being deleted automatically by Docker, they have to be removed manually. Right now we have a cron job removing all stopped containers every hour. 

If suddenly out of space on the production server, there are few Docker-related steps to be taken:

- check if there are containers running for too long with `docker ps`, if necessary, kill them with `docker rm <name/id>`
- check if there are too many stopped containers waiting to be removed
        - `docker ps -a` will show all container, running and stopped
        - `docker container prune` will remove all stopped containers
- restart Docker deamon with `sudo service docker restart`
- clean up all unused Docker objects with `docker system prune` (warning: can take a few minutes)

## Cron jobs

Cron is a Linux utility to schedule running of scripts or commands automatically at a specified time.

[Mininal Cron tutorial](https://www.ostechnix.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cron-jobs/).

To add, edit or remove a cron job in the user specific cron table, run `crontab -e`. 

**Important:** Cron will send the job outpus an email to every email address provided for the user. To disable emails, discard job output by adding `>/dev/null 2>&1` at the end of the job description.
